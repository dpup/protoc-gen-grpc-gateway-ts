# TypeScript Client Generator for gRPC Gateway

`protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts` is a TypeScript client generator for the [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/) project. It generates idiomatic TypeScript clients that connect the web frontend and golang backend frontend via a JSON/HTTP API.

> [!NOTE]
> The official gRPC ecosystem repository hasn't been updated in since 2022 and there are a number of pending pull requests and issues that would be good to resolve. @seanami and @dpup work for two separate organizations using this fork and intend to breath a bit of life into this project. We hope these changes can be merged upstream at some point.

## Features:

1. Idiomatic Typescript clients and messages.
2. Supports both one-way and server side streaming gRPC calls.
3. POJO request construction guarded by message type definitions, which is way easier compared to `grpc-web`.
4. No need to use swagger/open-api to generate client code for the web.

### Changes made since the April 2024 fork

1. [Support for well-known wrapper types](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts/pull/50)
2. Updated to support gRPC gateway v2 and latest protoc-gen-go
3. Support for proto3 optional fields
4. Support for deprecated message and field annotations
5. Updated to satisfy strict TS and eslint checks
6. Generator options managed through standard flags
7. Fixes for inconsistent field naming when fields contain numbers, e.g. `k8s_field` --> `k8sField`
8. Fixes for module names that contain dots or dashes
9. Option to generate _actually_ idiomatic functions with `use_static_classes=false`

## Getting Started:

You will need to install `protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts` before it could be picked up by the `protoc` command. Run:

```sh
go install github.com/dpup/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts
```

Then ensure that your gobin is on your path:

```sh
GOBIN=$(go env GOPATH)/bin
PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH
```

Now, `protoc` can be used to generate TypeScript definitions in addition to other languages. For example::

```sh
protoc --grpc-gateway-ts_out . input.proto
```

The generated file will be `input.pb.ts` in the same directory.

## Parameters:

### `use_proto_names` (Default: False)

By default the gRPC gateway uses `camelCaseFieldNames`. If the gateway has been configured to use the same format as defined in the proto file definition, then this flag should be set to true. See [protojson.MarshalOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson#MarshalOptions) for the server configuration.

### `emit_unpopulated` (Default: False)

Matches the behavior of [protojson.MarshalOptions](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson#MarshalOptions) with `EmitUnpopulated` option set to true. If true, zero values will be emited instead of dropped, so `{"str": ""}` instead of `{}`.

### `use_static_classes` (Default: True)

When true the generated client uses static classes in the form `SomeService.SomeMethod(req)`. When false,
functions are exported in the form `someMethod(req)` and a `SomeServiceClient` is generated that maintains
`initReq` as internal state.

### `ts_import_roots`

Since protoc plugins do not get the import path information as what's specified in `protoc -I`, this parameter gives the plugin the same information to figure out where a specific type is coming from so that it can generate `import` statement at the top of the generated typescript file. Defaults to `$(pwd)`

### `ts_import_root_aliases`

If a project has setup an alias for their import. This parameter can be used to keep up with the project setup. It will print out alias instead of relative path in the import statement. Default to "".

### `ts_import_roots` & `ts_import_root_aliases` are useful when you have setup import alias in your project with the project asset bundler, e.g. Webpack.

### `fetch_module_directory` and `fetch_module_filename`

`protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts` generates a shared typescript file with communication functions. These two parameters together will determine where the fetch module file is located. Default to `$(pwd)/fetch.pb.ts`

### `logtostderr`

Turn on logging to stderr. Default to false.

### `loglevel`

Defines the logging levels. Default to info. Valid values are: debug, info, warn, error

### Notes:

Zero-value fields are omitted from the URL query parameter list for GET requests. Therefore for a request payload such as `{ a: "A", b: "" c: 1, d: 0, e: false }` will become `/path/query?a=A&c=1`. A sample implementation is present within this [proto file](https://github.com/dpup/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts/blob/master/test/integration/protos/service.proto) in the integration tests folder. For further explanation please read the following:

- <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#default>
- <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto>

## Examples:

The following shows how to use the generated TypeScript code.

Proto file: `counter.proto`

```proto
// file: counter.proto
message Request {
  int32 counter = 1;
}

message Response {
  int32 result = 1;
}

service CounterService {
  rpc Increase(Request) returns (Response);
  rpc Increase10X(Request) returns (stream Response);
}
```

Run the following command to generate the TypeScript client:

`protoc --grpc-gateway-ts_out=. counter.proto`

Then a `counter.pb.ts` file will be available at the current directory. You can use it like the following example.

```ts
import { CounterService } from "./counter.pb";

// increase the given number once
async function increase(base: number): Promise<number> {
  const resp = await CounterService.Increase({ counter: base });
  return resp.result;
}

// increase the base repeatedly and return all results returned back from server
// the notifier after the request will be called once a result comes back from server streaming
async function increaseRepeatedly(base: number): Promise<number[]> {
  let results = [];
  await CounterService.Increase10X({ base }, (resp: Response) => {
    result.push(resp.result);
  });

  return results;
}
```

When `use_static_classes` is set to false, you can implement your code will look like this:

```ts
import { increase } from "./counter.pb";

// increase the given number once
async function increaseCount(base: number): Promise<number> {
  const resp = await increase({ counter: base });
  return resp.result;
}
```

or:

```ts
import { CounterServiceClient } from "./counter.pb";

async function increase(base: number): Promise<number> {
  const client = new CounterServiceClient({
    headers: { Authorization: AUTH_TOKEN },
  });
  const resp = await client.increase({ counter: base });
  return resp.result;
}
```

If you wish to make use of optional fields, you may find it beneficial to to configure the gRPC Gateway to emit zero values. Otherwise the client needs to know that a field is expected to be optional. See the `http get request with optional fields` test case to see the differences in response objects.

```go
  gateway := runtime.NewServeMux(runtime.WithMarshalerOption(runtime.MIMEWildcard, &runtime.HTTPBodyMarshaler{
    Marshaler: &runtime.JSONPb{
      MarshalOptions: protojson.MarshalOptions{
        EmitUnpopulated: true,
      },
    },
  }))
```

You should then pass `emit_unpopulated` as a parameter to the typescript plugin:

```bash
  protoc \
  ... \
  --grpc-gateway-ts_out ./ \
  --grpc-gateway-ts_opt emit_unpopulated=true \
  ...
```

## Development

Required dependencies:

    brew install typescript
    brew install golangci-lint

To run tests:

    make test

To see other commands run:

    make help

### Details on integration tests

The integration tests are frontend tests executed using [web test runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/). The tests connect to a gRPC server to verify that data round trips correctly.

Within the `/test/integration` directory, there are sub-folders which run tests using different configurations of the gRPC gateway and/or typescript generator. `/test/integration/run.js` starts the server and runs each folder one at a time.

If you run the tests manually you will need to regenerate the client and server files using the following make commands:

    make integration-test-client integration-test-server
